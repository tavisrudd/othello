# Codex task queue — delegated by Fable (2026-07-07)

**What this is:** the live task registry for the projective-cap / odd-plane program. It holds only
the current-state map — the priority view plus the genuinely-open tasks as one-line entries. Full
write-ups of completed tasks, the original ranking, and the Fable Nth-pass amendment trail were moved
to the companion log
[`2026-07-07-codex-task-queue-archive.md`](2026-07-07-codex-task-queue-archive.md) on 2026-07-11.

**Task-ID protocol:** one global monotonic `CNN` sequence (see CLAUDE.md). Each task names a report
file; Codex does the work, writes findings there (verbatim commands/outputs for machine checks), and
marks the entry `[REPORTED <date>]`. Never renumber or reuse an allocated ID. **Max allocated: C77.**

**Box:** compute up to ~8 GB / multi-core is fine; q ≥ 23 grid-cap campaigns and n=20 queens runs
still require an explicit user gate.

## CURRENT TOP OF QUEUE (updated 2026-07-11)

The odd-plane escape kernel — "every legal size-3 residual position has a P-valued size-4 child" —
is the active mathematics; (ON), requiring that child on the conic, is the stronger A5 route. The
config→value **mechanism sweep is closed-negative** (Cluster 1), so the two live proof lanes are
**A5 arc-depletion arithmetic** and the **C74/C77 one-intruder N-absorption theorem**. C75/C76 close
the current pointwise selector/invariant spaces; C77 closes the pure geometric bank and identifies
the game-semantic residue with C74's explicit pencil.

1. **Cluster 2 / C74 — the open core** (one-intruder pencil N-absorption + recursive reply closure).
   PRIMARY per C65's route verdict. Every constituent probe is REPORTED (archived C61–C63, C70, C71);
   the lane itself is open. C75 explains the selector wall; C76 answered the invariant prong
   (frame-relative characters cut collisions 48→1 but leave a residual hard twin, no monotone scalar,
   and no uniform linear selector ⇒ separation not selection). C77 now proves the reservoir-free
   DROP ledger is uniformly peak-bounded, but also shows that this geometric bound has no game-value
   content by itself. Its continuation finds the exact computed target **`Ncenters≤q−8`** on every
   maximum C74 pencil through q=19 (tight q=17); since `d≤5`, this leaves at least two P off-conic
   centers and would prove odd escape directly. The mechanism candidate is the value-blind two-stage
   packet `L=min d`, then `Low4(L)=` centers through the fourth-lowest off-conic support (ties kept):
   every packet has ≥3 P centers, while 1,332/1,344 non-maximum q17 lines fail. The q=11 knife-edge
   base compresses to four exact perfect-matching reply-graph types.
2. **A5 lane — arc-depletion arithmetic.** Sole surviving (ON) mechanism route. Open: prove
   `maxonN(q) ≤ q−5` for all depleted q. Min-witness bound holds through q=25; depleted set still
   `{11,17}`. Gated compute: the next-depleted-order census (q=29, ~16 GB / ~15–25 h — user gate).
3. **Independent lanes** — C30 (q17/q19 Lean cert assembly, long-running, gated) pulls in parallel.

## Open tasks

**Proof lanes (open; constituent probes archived as REPORTED):**

- **C76 [REPORTED 2026-07-11 — invariant prong answered]** —
  frame-relative characters (polar-at-frame, frame-chord, frame×tangent cross-ratio profiles) — the
  frame-awareness the (x,z)-local selector space omitted — cut the C75 collisions **48→1**: they split
  47/48 enumerated twins (polar+chord) and separate the winner/loser classes almost everywhere. **But
  the augmented space is NOT orbit-injective** (1 residual hard twin, q=17 axis points P `11,0`/N
  `16,0`), **no scalar reduction is monotone** (39/48 and 38/48 separators are direction-MIXED), and
  **no uniform linear selector exists** (C77-selector-test LP infeasible over d=37). So it buys
  separation, not selection — routing the escape proof to a **game-semantic reply closure**. Report:
  [`2026-07-11-c76-frame-aware-invariant-orbit-injectivity.md`](2026-07-11-c76-frame-aware-invariant-orbit-injectivity.md);
  scripts `rust/scripts/c76_invariant_hunt.py`, `c76_directional_search.py`, `c77_augmented_selector.py`.
- **C77 [REPORTED 2026-07-11 — DROP peak theorem proved; game-semantic certificate residue OPEN]** —
  C63's growing Ψ debt is entirely the loose `reservoir_slack` term. After deleting it, the pure
  conic ledger `DROP = 6·defect − 4·intruders − 2·[xor=0]` satisfies the **all-depth theorem**
  `DROP(S) ≤ DROP(root)=6(q−5)−2` for every odd q: an intruder pays `−4`; without intruders a proper
  descendant has at most `q−6` live conic vertices; the root's `q−5` isolates have xor zero. The q23
  solve is no longer needed for bank capacity or full-depth DROP debt. The `q−5` cross-lane check is
  **negative**: A5's `maxonN` is a class-extremal P/N count, while `defect_components` is a
  value-blind graph count fixed at `q−5` at the root; identifying them assumes the desired P witness.
  **Continuation:** the game-semantic residue is exactly C74's maximum-pencil absorption problem.
  Exact data gives `Ncenters≤q−8` at q=11/13/17/19 (tight q=17), while simple character/order
  selectors fail across q. The two-stage value-blind `Low4` packet contains ≥3 P centers on every
  maximum pencil; maximum-line selection is load-bearing by the non-maximum controls. All 32 distinct
  P centers in the q=11 knife-edge pencils have perfect winning-reply matchings in only four graph
  isomorphism types. **Open:** prove the `Low4` packet theorem/N-absorption bound or a recursive reply
  closure; do not spend more compute on the DROP envelope. Reports:

  scripts `rust/scripts/c77_pencil_value_probe.py`, `c77_intruder_reply_graph.py`.
- **A5 arithmetic proof** (open lane, no single ID) — `maxonN(q) ≤ q−5` for all arc-depleted q, plus
  the q=29 next-depleted-order census (gated compute). Anchor context:

- **C74 residue (now the C77 game-semantic continuation)** — prove the two-stage packet theorem:
  on a maximum (`min d`) one-intruder pencil, the fourth-order-statistic low-`zone_v` packet contains
  a P center (observed ≥3), implying `Ncenters≤q−8`; or prove an equivalent recursive reply closure.

**Independent / engineering:**

- **C30 [REPORTED 2026-07-10 — certcheck PASS; open engineering tail]** — generated-checker refactor →
  q17/q19 Lean assembly. The v5 full q17 canonical build projects above 21.5 h sequential, tripping the
  task's ~10 h user-launch gate; do not launch implicitly. Next = an explicit launch decision or a
  build-shape reduction, then q19 sizing.
- **C13 [OPEN]** — q=9 intrusion-structure probe (the next odd-plane Lean target; the q=9 Lean
  kernel/certificate is still open per the handoff Status Table). Report target
  `notes/2026-07-07-codex-q9-intrusion-probe.md`.
- **C16 [OPEN — dormant]** — sum-free Tactic 2, induction on `r` (`Z3^r × Z_p` is N iff r=1); a
  separate work stream, dormant unless resumed. Report target
  `notes/2026-07-07-codex-sumfree-induction-r.md`.
- **C56 [CLOSED-GATED — do not start]** — group-indexed cross-q type alignment; gated on a C55
  positive, and C55 is NEGATIVE, so it stays closed.

**Reported this pass:**

- **C76 [REPORTED 2026-07-11]** — frame-relative characters cut the C75 collisions 48→1 but leave a
  residual hard twin and no uniform selector (linear LP infeasible); invariant prong answered, ledger
  is the surviving lever. Report:

  scripts `rust/scripts/c76_invariant_hunt.py`, `rust/scripts/c76_directional_search.py`.
- **C75 [REPORTED 2026-07-11]** — value-blind reply-selector impossibility. 19 of 108 hard obligations
  hold a P and an N reply that are byte-identical on all 17 program features → the wall is
  feature-completeness, not coordinate choice, and the deficit grows with q (6% → 7% → 39%). Names the
  C76 invariant hunt and re-weights (ON) toward the amortized/ledger potential. Report:
