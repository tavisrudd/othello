# Reed--Solomon deep-hole programme

**Lane**: `reed-solomon`

**Date:** 2026-07-22

**Status:** C475 QUEUED; the C398 four-class theorem and C474 decorated-fibre computation are the
frozen base. The first lane task moves from exceptional non-GRS parents to the standard
redundancy-three GRS deep-hole problem.

## Goal

Develop intrinsic, computable invariants for projective deepest-syndrome directions of
redundancy-three generalized Reed--Solomon codes, prove exactly what they remember modulo the full
projective-semilinear code automorphism group, and isolate the first exceptional fibres where a
coarser invariant fails. Use the C398 non-GRS examples as controls, not as substitutes for the
standard-GRS problem.

The coding dictionary is fixed. If `H` is a `3 x n` parity-check matrix whose projective columns
form an arc `A` in `PG(2,q)`, then a projective syndrome `u` has coset weight three exactly when it
lies on no secant of `A`; equivalently, adjoining `u` gives a one-column MDS extension. For a
standard redundancy-three GRS code, `A` lies on a nonsingular conic.

## Context map

```text
C398 classification + certificate
  -> C474 decorated-fibre theorem + replay
       -> C475 coefficient atlas for standard GRS parents
            -> only after a collision: modular/descent discriminators
```

The older [`C121 q=11 checks`](../2026-07-13-c121-icosahedral-mds-checks.md) and
[`C122 deep-hole audit`](../2026-07-13-c122-deep-hole-novelty-audit.md) are archaeology only; C398
and C474 supersede them for lane entry.

Use the [`papers index`](../../papers/papers-index.md) as the cross-paper theorem registry. Adjacent
banks are opt-in, by obstruction shape:

| Bank | Exact handles | Use in this lane |

| `arcs_complete_outside_conic` | `thm-arc-mds-syndrome`, `thm-relative-syndrome-confinement`, `thm-extension-conflict-hypergraph`, `thm-defect-leader-collision`, `thm-evaluation-dichotomy` | Foundational syndrome/extension semantics, moment constraints, and evaluation-rank obstructions. See the [`arcs` handoff](done/2026-07-12-arcs-complete-outside-conic-formalization.md) and [proof audit](../../papers/arcs_complete_outside_conic/arcs_complete_outside_conic_proof_audit.md). |

| `complete-repair-ports` | `thm-repair-coefficients` | Warning/control: raw recovery coefficients vary under monomial rescaling, so only gauge-invariant combinations can classify. |
| Higher-order-MDS branch | [`C295`](../2026-07-17-c295-intrinsic-continuation-reconstruction.md), plus `comp-q11-extension-complex` | Simultaneous-extension input only; not needed for the one-column C475 gate. |

Do not recompute the four C398 fibres, their deletion traces, the q=9 cube, or their automorphism
orbits unless a new invariant exposes a concrete inconsistency. They are regression controls.

## Current frontier — C475

For an ordered conic support `h_1,...,h_n` and deepest syndrome direction `u`, begin with the
intrinsic minors

```text
d_ij(u) = det(u,h_i,h_j).
```

Raw support incidence is trivial on a deepest syndrome because every `d_ij` is nonzero. C475 must
therefore pass to scale-free bounded-degree combinations: determinant cross-ratios, cubic products,
or an equivalent coefficient atlas. It must:

1. derive the transformation law under column rescaling, syndrome scaling, projectivities,
   Frobenius, and the conic-support automorphism group;
2. state and prove which combinations descend to the unlabelled projective-semilinear orbit;
3. compute a lossless exact atlas on the smallest feasible standard-GRS cases and compare its
   fibres with exact automorphism orbits;
4. replay the same invariants on all four frozen C398 classes as positive/negative controls; and
5. if separation fails, stop at the first collision and characterize the entire collision fibre
   before proposing any stronger invariant.

The deliverable is
[`notes/2026-07-22-c475-reed-solomon-determinant-atlas.md`](../2026-07-22-c475-reed-solomon-determinant-atlas.md),
with exact scripts/data beside it if finite computation is used. A successful small-field atlas is
not yet a general classification theorem; any extrapolation must be separately labelled.

## Boundaries

- This lane owns Reed--Solomon/GRS deep-hole and one-column MDS-extension invariants arising from
  the C398/C474 bridge.
- It does not own further Clebsch, crowns, type-theory, or stable-module development. Cross-lane
  consequences require their own routing and may not mutate the crowns handoff.
- Literature priority or a claim of progress on a famous conjecture requires a dedicated current
  literature audit. The present task is an internal theorem-and-discriminator programme.
- Avoid an unstructured field census. Normalize first, prove the group action, and enumerate only
  the resulting bounded quotient.
