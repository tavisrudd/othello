## Goal

Produce one short theorem-led complete-ports manuscript whose main proof spine consists of complete
human proofs and whose formal coverage is stated claim by claim. Computations, finite tables,
certificates, and replay machinery may support appendices but may not carry a body theorem. Public
release remains a separate fresh-history operation that never publishes the private monorepo or its
history.

## Main-proof admission rule

A result enters the body proof spine only when it has:

1. an exact stable paper statement;
2. a complete human proof exposing the mathematical mechanism;
3. an explicit formal-coverage classification;
4. exact attribution of every imported mathematical input; and
5. no computation or certificate in its logical dependency chain.

Only the associated-pair exact sequence is currently Lean-complete.  Every stronger theorem is
marked absent from the paper-local Lean package and is supported by its human proof and cited
classical inputs.

## Current paper spine

Working title: *Exact Transfer of Bounded Linear Recovery and Relative Weight
Hierarchies*.

1. recovery sets, normalized recovery equations, and stochastic repair as
   distinct forgetful layers;
2. the associated nested code pair and its exact sequence;
3. relative generalized Hamming weights as the exact minimum helper costs for
   recovering subspaces of each dimension;
4. exact eventual confinement and transfer of all normalized equations;
5. the best-target GHW identity, cooperative-locality min--max corollary, and
   MDS rigidity;
6. positive-density realization and bounded service-rate-region transfer;
7. reliability and coefficient-presentation separations beyond the RGHW
   hierarchy;
8. the projective simplex code as the principal non-MDS application; and
9. compact formal-verification and reproducibility appendices.

Use only established coding-theory terminology. “Associated nested code pair”
is a literal description of $K_P\subseteq D_P$, not a coined term. Research
and referee reports must contain factual findings and result ordering only;
they must not contain percentiles, venue-prestige judgments, or overall-quality
grades that could bias later cold reads.

## Lane lineage and ownership

C277 created this paper-preparation lane and moved exactly C274--C276 into it. All C111--C224
theorem/formalization work remains pegged to `repaircodes`; `RepairCodes` and `RepairPorts` Lean
names remain unchanged. Future manuscript, clean-export, citation, and paper-release tasks use
`[complete-ports]`.

**Discovery companion**: [complete-ports discovery track](../complete-ports-discovery-track.md).

Completed strengthening:

- [C952 manuscript rebuild](../2026-08-24-c952-recovery-manuscript-rebuild.md)
  produces the 17-page theorem-led paper, strengthens confinement to its exact
  finite outer gate, gives the target/helper-symmetric MDS staircase, records
  the four-terminal paper-local Lean boundary, and passes independent referee
  and exact-manifest standalone checks without export or push.

- [C944 recovery-terminology revision](../2026-08-22-c944-complete-ports-recovery-terminology.md)
  removes “port” as visible technical terminology, distinguishes exact helper
  supports from the upward-closed recovery-set family, preserves normalized
  recovery coefficients, passes an independent cold read after five minor
  edit repairs, distinguishes the transfer theorem explicitly from Jin--Fu's
  fixed-inner parameter constructions, and exports the verified 23-page
  standalone artifact.
- [C939 unified asymptotic separation revision](../2026-08-21-c939-complete-ports-unified-asymptotic-separation.md)
  proves the matched-availability structural seed pair, lifts it to
  positive-density asymptotically good families, passes final cold/formal
  review, and leaves a verified local public export; no push or deposit was
  made.

Sequel research:

- [C946 multi-target recovery and exact confinement](../2026-08-22-c946-multitarget-recovery-confinement.md)
  derives the restricted-dual splitting object and proves the exact finite and
  eventual helper-union thresholds reducing to the one-target theorem; C948
  closes its cold-read and generalized-weight gates.
- [C947 recovery-cost lattice and theory audit](../2026-08-22-c947-recovery-cost-lattice-theory.md)
  proves that the demand cost is finite-field minimum joint row support,
  neither submodular nor supermodular and NP-complete already for one binary
  demand; it packages all presented-demand lifts as a Yoneda representable and
  bounds the arithmetic-matroid/Smith-normal-form sequel. It is math-only and
  made no manuscript or formal-boundary change.
- [C948 recovery of target subspaces and relative-weight confinement](../2026-08-22-c948-rank-stratified-recovery-hierarchy.md)
  proves that the RGHWs of the associated nested pair are the exact minimum
  helper costs, derives the sharp dimension-by-dimension confinement threshold,
  best-target GHW identity, MDS rigidity, service-rate and reliability
  corollaries, projective example, and coefficient-presentation separation;
  its independent proof reread closes all findings and selects the primary-paper
  rebuild above. BGS/disjoint-recovery work remains a separate gated project.

## Publication boundary

Every paper is a fresh-history allowlisted export. Never publish, fork, history-filter, or broadly
copy the private monorepo. This paper's formal companion is the paper-local Mathlib package listed
in its exact 37-file distribution manifest; monorepo trust files and local `lean/AGENTS.md` norms are
excluded. The shared Lean monorepo remains separately owned. Never copy raw build trees or selected
`.olean` files.

## Current scope

The rebuilt manuscript contains the associated nested code pair, its RGHW
interpretation, exact finite and eventual rank-stratified confinement,
best-target GHW and cooperative-locality consequences, the symmetric MDS
staircase and rigidity, positive-density and service-rate transfer, reliability
and coefficient-presentation separations, and the projective-simplex family.
Extended EXIT, deletion--contraction, secondary geometries, vector bandwidth,
generic coefficient optimization, and BGS packing remain outside this paper.

## Next step

C952 is closed. Run C325 appendix-only verification next, then C953 aggregate
referee/export review. Before nontrivial proof development or
formalization, read the paper-specific expert dossier
[`papers/expert-profiles/05-complete-repair-ports.md`](../../papers/expert-profiles/05-complete-repair-ports.md).

The prior monolithic draft and its cold reads remain inputs, not acceptance of the modular
hierarchy. C220 remains omitted. Shared-Lean extraction is planned under
[C287](../2026-07-17-c287-shared-lean-extraction-plan.md), remains separately build-system-owned,
and is not evidence for or a release dependency of the paper-local companion.

Public export remains gated on C325 and C953 plus the explicit mirror/export workflow. The approved
repository metadata and private rename do not authorize synchronization, publication, or push.
