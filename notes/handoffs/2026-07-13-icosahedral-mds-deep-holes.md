# Icosahedral MDS / deep-holes = conic — spin-off lane

**Date**: 2026-07-13
**Status**: New lane, spun out of the papers-index #3 spin-off pick (`comp-q11-mds-deep-holes`).
Core structural theorem **confirmed computationally** by Fable against the Lean coordinates: the
q=11 non-GRS `[6,3,4]₁₁` code's 6-arc is the polar image of the six icosahedral (A₅) axes, deep
holes = the conic. Now proving the group/decoder consequences (C121) and checking novelty (C122).
**Next session**: land **C121** (A₅ / 2-transitivity / single-orbit-leaders Lean checks), then
decide on the **C123** twisted-cubic k=4 dual-variety test (see Doors).
**Companion log**: append dated riffs to
[`done/2026-07-13-icosahedral-mds-deep-holes-archive.md`](done/2026-07-13-icosahedral-mds-deep-holes-archive.md)
(create on first archive).
**Related lanes**: arcs manuscript (`arcs_complete_outside_conic`, Prop `prop:q11-code`);
[twisted-cubic transversal-spectrum](2026-07-13-twisted-cubic-transversal-spectrum.md) (k=4 lift
lives there); paper #1 icosahedral-extension-complex (`comp-q11-icosahedral`) — this lane **fuses
with it** via the A₅ orbit.

## The object

The projectively **non-GRS `[6,3,4]₁₁` MDS code** of covering radius 3 (`comp-q11-mds-deep-holes`,
Lean `RelativeConicArcs/Q11Coding.lean`, `Q11Semantic*.lean`, coords `Examples.lean:46`,
conic `XZ=Y²`). Equivalently a **6-arc off every conic** in PG(2,11).

**Confirmed structure (Fable, against Lean coords):**
- Each of the 6 arc points is an **external point** of the deep-hole conic; its two tangency points
  are exactly its **missed antipodal pair** (`witness_chords_miss_antipodes`, `witnessMissingEdge`;
  all six match, e.g. witness 0 = (1,10,0), tangents {0,9} = missing edge (0,9)).
- So the **arc = poles of the six antipodal chords = poles of the six 5-fold axes of the A₅
  (icosahedral) action** on the 12 conic points (A₅ ⊂ PGL₂(11), classical at q=11).
- **Arc stabilizer in the conic stabilizer PGL₂(11) is exactly order 60 = A₅**; point-stabilizer
  order 10 = D₁₀. Single A₅-orbit.
- This answers *why* deep holes are a conic and **unifies this lane with paper #1**.

## Verified facts (cheap, Lean-able)

- Coset-leader-weight distribution **(1, 60, 1150, 120)**, sums to 11³=1331. `60=6×10`,
  **`120 = 12×10`** = (12 conic points)×(10 scalars) — "deep holes = conic" made quantitative.
- Codeword weight enumerator **(1,0,0,0,150,420,760)** (MDS-forced; verified vs formula).
- **(900,150,100)** = split of the 1150 distance-2 cosets by leader count (1/2/3), tied to the
  secant-index spectrum (90,15,10)×10 (`Q11SemanticLeaders.lean`, `Q11SemanticSpectrum.lean`). NOT
  the min-weight codewords (=150) — do not conflate (numerical coincidence only).
- **Every deep-hole coset has exactly C(6,3)=20 leaders** (uniform 20-way tie).
- Code is **not completely regular** (distance-2 leader counts non-constant) → no naive
  association scheme.

## Open frontiers (ranked surprising × plausible)

| ID | Claim | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| R1 | Aut(code) = A₅ as the **exotic S₆-hexad** action; permutation aut group is **2-transitive** on the 6 coords (generic MDS: trivial) | **C121 CONFIRMED** — order 60, cycle-type census (1+15+20+24) = A₅ exotic action; pair-orbit size 30 |
| R2 | A₅ **symmetry-reduced decoder**: weight enum forced by 2-transitivity; deep-hole leaders reduce to orbit reps | **C121 REVISED** — the 20 wt-3 leaders split into **TWO complementary orbits of size 10** (S and Sᶜ always differ), NOT one. Decoder stores **2 reps not 20** (still a real 10× reduction); "single orbit" was wrong |
| R3 | **Conjecture:** deep holes of a non-GRS `[n,k]` MDS code = F_q-points of the **dual variety** of the RNC. k=3: dual of conic = conic ✓. **k=4: tangent developable = quartic surface** | C123 conjecture; partly testable vs `ProjectiveTwistedCubicTransversalSpectrum.lean` |
| R4 | **Construction principle:** poles of a group orbit → code with prescribed deep-hole variety; family exists where `ρ_𝒞(q) < t₂(2,q)` meets an A₅/A₄ orbit (q=8,9 six-arcs are ordinarily complete → radius 2, empty deep holes) | conjecture |
| R5 | Non-RS 3-of-6 secret sharing: positionally fair (A₅-transitive, uniform 20-tie) but **not pseudorandom** (deep holes enumerable as 12 conic points; roles leak via 2-transitivity) | reasoning |

## Closed / mirage (do NOT claim)

- **M₁₁ / PSL(2,11)-on-11-points / (11,5,2) biplane** — MIRAGE. Those live on 11 points, PSL(2,11)
  order 660; our object is on the **12 conic points**, A₅ order 60. Lead with the icosahedron, drop
  Mathieu.
- **Sphere-packing / lattices** — no credible bridge; natural home is designs / OA(1331,6,11,3).

## Novelty audit (C122 — `notes/2026-07-13-c122-deep-hole-novelty-audit.md`)

- **DROP "first non-GRS deep-hole determination"** — contradicted by 2025–26 ETGRS/TRS literature
  (Wu–Ding–Chen, IEEE TIT 71(5) 2025; TRS ISIT 2024 arXiv:2403.11436; Ma–Kai–Zhu FFA 2026).
- **The (1,60,1150,120) distribution, `120=(q−1)c₀`, and the uniform 20-way tie are KNOWN
  machinery**, not novelties: Davydov–Marcugini–Pambianco (arXiv:2101.12722, 2021) derive coset
  distributions from the secant spectrum and force `B₃=C(n,3)` for every such code. Keep them as
  worked facts, not headline claims.
- **2-transitive A₅ on 6 coords has a precedent:** the **hexacode `[6,3,4]₄`** (hyperoval in
  PG(2,4)) has PAut=A₅ 2-transitive. So frame R1 as *the F₁₁ / off-conic analogue of the hexacode
  phenomenon*, not as unprecedented. Our exact q=11 code has no prior appearance found.
- **Genuinely NEW (safe to headline):** *the code's complete deep-hole set = the F_q-points of a
  named variety (a conic)*, with a **group-theoretic cause** (poles of the six icosahedral axes) —
  first such identification; plus the **dual-variety conjecture** (R3) as its generalization (no
  prior art states deep holes = F_q-points of the dual variety / tangent developable).
- **BLOCKING CHECK before any submission:** O'Keefe–Storme, *"Arcs fixed by A₅ and A₆"* (J. Geom.
  1996) and *"Primitive arcs in PG(2,q)"* (JCTA 1995) are paywalled and are exactly where this arc
  would already be catalogued. Obtain and check before claiming the arc is new.

## Paper framing

Lead with: *complete deep-hole set of an MDS code identified with the rational points of a named
variety (a conic), caused by a 2-transitive A₅ acting as poles of the icosahedral axes* — plus the
dual-variety conjecture. (NOT "first non-GRS deep-hole determination.") One-liners by audience:
- coding theorist — *an MDS code with a 2-transitive aut group whose covering radius is realized on
  a conic*;
- finite-geometer — *the six poles of the icosahedral axes form a complete-outside-the-conic arc,
  stabilizer the exotic-hexad A₅*;
- group theorist — *the S₆ outer automorphism realized as conic polarity over F₁₁*.

Guardrail: respect the papers-planning salami-slicing check before splitting from the arcs
manuscript.
