# C834 — Paper IV full Lean release closure

**Lane:** `clebsch`

**Status:** active; required dependency of C761 by author direction 2026-08-02

## Objective

Replace Paper IV's partial formal mirror by a theorem-complete public Lean
development before release.  The terminal theorem must cover the complete
published result: parameters \([78,36,12]_2\), all 364 minimum words and their
four intrinsic families, spanning by every family, exact weighted-pair
reconstruction, the full marked \(\operatorname{PG}(2,13)\), and the
automorphism group.

## Meaning of “full Lean”

For release purposes, a paper theorem is fully formalized only when its public
aggregate has no declaration-local native-evaluation axiom, no trusted Python
premise, and no unformalized human transport.  Ordinary foundational axioms
reported by Mathlib—such as choice, propositional extensionality, and quotient
soundness—are permitted and must be listed.  Python programs may remain as
independent cross-checks but carry no logical weight.

Proof-producing reflection, kernel reduction, generated proof terms, and
proved reusable finite certificates are permitted.  `native_decide` is not a
release proof endpoint.

## Required closure packets

1. **Incidence and dimension:** kernel-check the normalized conic, polarity,
   incidence matrix, rank 42, and code dimension 36.
2. **Distance:** internalize the weight-eight tangent/theta argument, including
   PSD and the equality/kernel calculation, and the weight-ten moment plus all
   stabilizer exclusions; derive minimum distance 12 without a trusted search.
3. **Minimum layer:** prove the complete 364-word exhaustion, identify one
   octahedral and three toric families intrinsically, compute stabilizers and
   prove every family spans.
4. **Pair recovery:** prove the exact pair table, the fused-color splitter,
   color-eight recovery of every polar row, parity-image equality with the
   code, unary constancy, and exact arity two.
5. **Symmetry and plane:** prove the scheme automorphism theorem, construct the
   fourteen Sylow-13 subgroups and 169 involutions internally, prove the three
   incidence rules, identify the resulting 183-point plane and polarity, and
   recover the original internal block.
6. **Hidden field:** construct the operator field, prove its identification
   with \(\mathbf F_8\), the equivalence \(K\simeq\mathbf F_8^{12}\), the three
   scalar actions, and the Gram/spanning consequences.
7. **Release aggregate:** expose one theorem matching the manuscript's main
   theorem, run a complete `#print axioms` audit, generate a theorem-to-source
   map, and make the public release gate reject native/trusted placeholders.

## Engineering constraints

- Reuse the shared semantic geometry; do not create a second coordinate model.
- Shard expensive proof-producing computations and keep generated artifacts
  deterministic, reviewable, and hash-addressed.
- Each packet must have a cheap focused build before entering the aggregate.
- Keep statement identities synchronized with the manuscript; if a statement
  cannot be formalized as written, repair the proof or report the precise
  mathematical blocker rather than weakening it silently.

## Acceptance

- A clean public checkout builds the full aggregate under the pinned toolchain.
- The aggregate theorem matches every clause of the manuscript main theorem.
- Its axiom closure contains no native-evaluation or project-local axiom and no
  trusted-execution premise.
- Every former Python/native/human boundary is either a Lean proof or an
  explicitly cited imported Lean theorem whose assumptions match exactly.
- Independent Python replay, source hygiene, warning-free PDF, isolated build,
  and immutable-artifact checks pass.
- Only after C834 is complete may C761 request publication authority.

## Stop boundary

C834 does not add new mathematical claims, pursue all-\(q\) generalizations,
or publish externally.  Its sole purpose is proof-complete formalization of the
frozen Paper IV theorem.
