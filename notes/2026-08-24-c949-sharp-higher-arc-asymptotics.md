# C949 — sharp asymptotics for complete higher arcs

**Lane**: `relconic`

**Status:** queued after C945's theorem and literature gates; no manuscript work

## Purpose and boundary

C949 is the construction/extremal sequel to C945, not an enlargement of the
current arcs manuscript.  C945 owns the integer-envelope and modular-lift lower
bound.  C949 asks whether that obstruction is sharp for a canonical extremal
function and, if so, whether the extremizers are explained by the same
arithmetic structure.

Nothing below is a novelty or attainability claim.  Literature statements and
any eventual priority verdict remain subject to
`literature-audit-conventions.md`; C945's recorded source depths and uncovered
databases are inherited as open gates, not converted into negative evidence.

## Canonical first target

Avoid the collision between the standard subscript in `t_s(2,q)` and the
normalization `q/3` by writing

```text
q=3^h,                 s_q=2q/3+1,
T_3(q)=t_{s_q}(2,q).
```

C945 proves the lower bound

```text
T_3(q) >= q^2/3+4q/3-o(q).                            (LB3)
```

The first conjectural construction target is

```text
T_3(q) <= q^2/3+4q/3+o(q),                            (UB3)
```

which would give

```text
T_3(q) = q^2/3+4q/3+o(q),       q=3^h -> infinity.   (ASY3)
```

This is a characteristic-three target.  It is not a nonsquare-field statement
unless the tower is explicitly restricted to odd `h`.

Equivalently, if `B` is the complement of a complete `(k,s_q)`-arc, then `B`
is a minimal `q/3`-fold blocking set: every line meets `B` at least `q/3`
times, and every point of `B` lies on a line meeting it exactly `q/3` times.
Thus minimizing `k` is the complementary problem of maximizing the size of
such a minimal multiple blocking set.  This complement `B` must be kept
distinct from the dual point set representing a chosen family of maximal
secants.

## Construction problem

The main bottleneck is construction, not a further repackaging of the lower
bound.  Near equality in C945 predicts a bounded edit of a modular or
two-character dual object.  The useful converse problem is deliberately weaker
than reconstructing the entire maximal-secant family:

> Give sufficient conditions on a line family `L` for the existence of a point
> set `A` such that every line of `L` is an `s_q`-secant of `A`, no line meets
> `A` more than `s_q` times, and `L` covers every point outside `A`.

Equality between `L` and the set of all maximal secants is unnecessary for an
upper bound and should not be imposed unless classification requires it.

The bounded construction programmes are:

1. **Perturbed modular/two-character cores.**  Start from a line or point
   multiset with the predicted congruence spectrum, make `O(1)` or `o(q)`
   edits, and test the weaker realization criterion above.
2. **Trace, additive-level, and field-reduction constructions.**  A single
   fixed-rank linear set usually has only `O(q)` points, whereas the target arc
   has order `q^2`; use complements, large unions, or level sets rather than
   treating one sparse linear set as the arc.
3. **Curve-derived constructions.**  Fixed-degree curves have the same density
   mismatch.  The plausible objects are complements, trace-defined sets, or
   reducible/high-degree families with controlled maximal secants.
4. **Valid extension towers.**  Do not lift from `F_{3^{h-1}}` to `F_{3^h}`:
   that subfield generally does not exist.  Recursive constructions must use
   exponent towers with divisibility, for example `h_i | h_{i+1}`, or maps
   defined directly over each `F_{3^h}`.

## First computational gate

1. Audit known constructions at `s=2q/3+1`, translating each into both the
   complementary blocking-set and selected-secant languages.
2. For `q=9`, determine the exact feasible range but treat it as a noisy base
   case rather than asymptotic evidence.
3. For `q=27`, search only symmetry-constrained families—Singer/cyclic orbits,
   trace-invariant sets, subgroup-orbit unions, and modular-core candidates.
4. Search for a covering family of candidate maximal secants before demanding
   realization as the complete maximal-secant set.
5. Record whether examples approach the linear coefficient `4/3`, exceed it
   systematically, or show no stable pattern.

Proceed toward `(ASY3)` only if a structured family has
`k=q^2/3+O(q)` and the correct maximum line intersection.  If computation
instead exposes a larger linear term, return the pattern to C945 as a candidate
new obstruction.  If neither occurs, retain C949 as a bounded negative
construction audit rather than an open-ended search.

## Later targets, conditional on the first gate

A density-interval theory would write `s=alpha q+O(1)` and seek

```text
t_s(2,q)=f(alpha)q^2+g(alpha; p, tower, residues)q+o(q).
```

The first-order term cannot in general be indexed by `alpha` alone: C945's
mechanism depends on characteristic, the field tower, and congruence data.  A
A piecewise arithmetic phase-transition theorem is deferred until one branch
has matching constructions.

The projective-code translation—to minimum length for robustly nonextendible
projective `[k,3,k-s]_q` codes—may broaden the eventual audience, but the
finite-geometry extremal function remains primary.

## Scope and stopping rule

- `(LB3)` belongs to C945; C949 owns the construction problem.
- A matching `(UB3)` would determine the two displayed asymptotic terms.
- Stability or classification would describe near-extremal or extremal
  configurations in addition to determining the value.
- A density-interval theorem would extend the calculation from one parameter
  family to a nontrivial interval of `alpha`.

C949 does not start until C945 has a settled theorem package and manuscript
disposition.  It must not delay the existing arcs paper's review/release path.
