# Lean companion to the cubic-stabilization irrationality paper

This is a paper-local Mathlib package. Its top-level namespace is

```text
TavisRuddFiniteGeom.Papers.CubicStabilizationIrrationality
```

and its reviewer-facing entry point is

```text
TavisRuddFiniteGeom.Papers.CubicStabilizationIrrationality.PaperInterface
```

The modules isolate the fixed-phase identification interface. Lean checks the
crossed-row algebra, endpoint-indexed path syntax, monodromy-image
functoriality, and naturality of the directed projected variation. Vector
crossed-coordinate equations derive the model row reading. The reduced
horizontal reader proves that one marked comparison intertwining the two
monodromies transports model-side vanishing to an externally supplied actual
receiver when its induced incoming-image map is surjective.
The trait-level module proves the weaker specialization law actually consumed
by the vanishing argument: pointwise specialized variation commutes with a
marked semilinear comparison, so a normal-factor reading whose normal maps to
zero kills the fibre variation without asserting a tensor-product description
of the image packet.
Common outputs carry a dependent provenance witness indexed by their actual
value: marking an output as moving-produced requires a moving source whose
crossed image is that value.
Environment-indexed endpoints compute the quantum path from the chamber path
and share their phase, character, and direction as type parameters, so those
compatibility equations are obtained by construction.

The geometric comparison with the actual QDM packet remains an explicit
inhabited-structure proposition. In particular, the package does not assume
that monodromy-image formation commutes with specialization. An application
may provide a marked semilinear comparison whose induced incoming image spans
the fibre packet. An explicit range base-change certificate is a stronger
implementation of that coverage condition; the monodromy and row compatibility
remain separate data.
